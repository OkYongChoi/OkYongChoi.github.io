# Barbalat's Lemma
source: [link](https://www.example.com/my%20great%20page)
The Barbalat’s lemma is used for time-varying systems. It is important when analyzing non-autonomous systems.
## Definition
When $f(t)$ converges, and when $f’(t)$ is uniformly continuous or $f’’(t)$ converges, 
for a uniformly continuous function $f(t)$, $\lim_{t\to\infty} f'(t) = 0$, if the following conditions holds.


$$
|t−t_n| \le \delta \\
|f(t)−f(t_n)| \le \epsilon
$$

## Application

## Proof (by Contradiction)
Let's assume that $\lim_{t\to\infty} f'(t) \ne 0$, in which the above conditions are met.
