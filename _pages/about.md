My name is Okyong Choi, and I am doing a master's degree in Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) Robotics program. Before coming to KAIST, I attended Hanyang University, where I received bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in 2019 and worked for about 2 years at Samsung Electronics in charge of speech signal processing.

I am interested in learning and decision making under uncertainty. My recent research focuses on reinforcement learning, deep learning and its applications. Head over to my [research page](/research) for more information. 

<!-- Research Interests  
Machine Learning Theory:
Reinforcement learning (RL), multi-agent systems (MAS), graph neural networks (GNNs) partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), optimization

Machine Learning Applications:
Recommendation, quantitative analysis of finance, speech enhancement 

Research Environment in Cloud (GCP, AWS etc)
GO language study
Asset Investing (Portfolio, Risk Management, Macro-Finance etc)

Iâ€™m currently working on ðŸ”­
Developing open-domain dialog system whose name is Luda
Building Korean MRC(Machine Reading Comprehesion) Dataset at KLUE
Trying hard to reduce the Learning Machine Learning(LML) loss ðŸ˜‚
Coding everyday for better research engineering skill

Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸŒ±
Theoretical Machine Learning from the basic
Tensorflow 2.x
Research Environment in Cloud (GCP, AWS etc)
GO language study
Asset Investing (Portfolio, Risk Management, Macro-Finance etc)

## Interests

I like to program random things and solve programming or math problems in my free time.
<!-- I currently  run, play soccer, and go to the gym (when I can wake up early enough). -->
